## Project Description:
This capstone project is from the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
course from Coursera. Specifically this is the Applied Data Science Captsone Proejct. 

In this capstone, I aim to predict if the falcon 9 first stage will land sucessfully.
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 
million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, 
much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

To complete this project, I followed the data science methodology of data collection,
data visualization, model development, model evaluation, gathering data-driven insights,
and completing data storytelling. 

## Project Goal:
My goal is to accurately predict that the first stage rocket will land, and based on that 
information determine the cost of a launch.
